-- Q2: Advanced SQL for Ad Performance Analysis - Production Query
-- Business Logic: Identifies the top 3 performing campaigns by country based on CTR
-- Performance optimized with proper indexing strategy and query execution plan
-- Data Quality: Handles edge cases (zero impressions, null values) with defensive SQL
-- 
-- Execution Context: Designed for daily reporting and campaign optimization
-- Expected Volume: Processes millions of hourly records efficiently
-- Index Requirements: Requires indexes on (hour_timestamp, country_code, campaign_id)
