## Overview

TabulaRasa BI Core is a production-grade, low-latency data engineering platform demonstrating modern AdTech analytics patterns. Built as a comprehensive technical assessment, it showcases real-time streaming, advanced SQL analytics, performance optimization, and scalable API design within a unified, observable system.

## Business Value

This platform addresses multiple stakeholder requirements:

- **Executive Leadership**: Real-time business KPIs with sub-5-second latency from event occurrence
- **Data Engineering Teams**: Production-ready Spark Structured Streaming with exactly-once semantics
- **Backend Engineering Teams**: Comprehensive Spring Boot APIs with full observability stack
- **DevOps/SRE Teams**: Complete containerized infrastructure with monitoring and alerting
- **Technical Assessment**: Structured evaluation of engineering practices across four core domains

## Technical Assessment Structure

The project demonstrates expertise across four key data engineering challenges:

| Component | Focus Area | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **[Q3: Java Performance Optimization](root/q3_java_refactoring/)** | Code Quality & Efficiency | Algorithmic improvements and modern Java best practices |
| **[Q4: API Design & Integration](root/q4_api_design_client/)** | REST API Design | Robust event ingestion with idempotency and error handling |

## System Architecture

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+ (OpenJDK recommended)
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose 24.0+
- Python 3.10+ (for dashboards and data generation)

### Production Stack Deployment
```bash
# Build all components
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Launch complete infrastructure
docker compose -f root/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Start application with Spark cluster integration
./run.sh prod spark
```

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Launch minimal infrastructure (PostgreSQL + Kafka only)
docker compose -f root/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d tabularasa_postgres_db kafka

# Run with embedded Spark (local mode)
./run.sh prod simple
```
